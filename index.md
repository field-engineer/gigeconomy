The Emerging Startup Special Mention placed Fieldengineer.com in good company with multinational technology giants, such as Huawei and PCCW Global. The awards drew highly regarded international visitors and speakers who represented their companies and shared novel ideas that are sure to shape the way telecom technology practices evolve for years to come. FieldEngineer.com CEO and founder, Malik Zakaria, was also in attendance, and he delivered a well-received presentation that shed light on how enterprises could continue overcoming the hurdles associated with providing services in a world of rapid internet expansion and B2B workforce growth.

According to Zakaria, the mention served as a welcome acknowledgment of his company's progress. "Since the beginning, we've dedicated ourselves to making career management easier for field engineers and empowering telecom companies to tap into pools of highly skilled specialists," Zakaria said. "Although we've faced challenges along the way, we're proud to be redefining the way professionals make the connections that help them drive their careers forward."
